      <h2 class="hello">Hello!</h2>
      <p>My name is Jae and I am a crocheter based in Auckland, New Zealand.</p>
      <p>In 2010, I was on a holiday for a few months after finishing the first year of university. Being bored, I looked for things to do and found an old crochet amigurumi pattern book from the storage. I asked Mum to help me learn. From the moment I had my first hook and yarn in my hands, I couldn't stop. I spent the next few days just crocheting - I was completely addicted! Crochet has been my number one hobby since then.</p>
      <p><span>"Why do you call yourself a hooker?"</span> you might ask. Hooker is a term that refers to crocheters because we use a crochet hook rather than knitting needles (yes, crochet and knitting are two different things). So if you're here looking for another kind of hooker, you're in the wrong place!</p>
      <p>Here on Hooked!, I post pictures of my crochet products. Please feel free to contact me if you'd like to buy them or learn to crochet :)</p>
